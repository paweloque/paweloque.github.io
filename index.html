<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Pawel Kowalski</h1>
<p class="mb-4">
I am a software engineer with over 15 years of experience in building digital products. I am passionate about taking ideas 
and shaping them into successful products by building prototypes, validating them, and turning them into reality. I see 
myself as someone at the intersection of technology, product design, and people. Throughout my career, I have written code, 
designed products, and led engineering teams.

<p class="mb-4">
My interest in education led me to develop <a href="https://lernpfad.ch/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Lernpfad.ch</a>, a micropublishing platform that allows teachers to create structured learning scenarios for their students.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
A few years ago, I worked as the CTO at a Swisscom subsidiary, Mila.com, where we participated in a Swisscom bug bounty program. This experience inspired me to start <a href="https://gobugfree.com/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">GObugfree.com</a>, a crowd-sourced application security platform that makes the bug bounty approach accessible to all digital products.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
My work in the digital product domain has allowed me to build a large network of people working in this area. This experience materialized into <a href="https://bettersource.ch/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">BetterSource.ch</a>, a local network of freelance software engineers, product designers, and UX designers that helps businesses find the right freelancers for their digital projects.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
Currently, I'm working as a tech lead at Bedag AG on a project to migrate an old COBOL system to a Java system for the fulfillment of taxation in the Kanton of Bern. This project is challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited to apply my skills and expertise to contribute to the successful completion of this project by understanding the technology and the mechanics of engineering teams.
